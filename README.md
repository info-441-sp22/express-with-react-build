To run the project:

run in this folder: npm install
then cd into the client folder and also run: npm install
(TODO: perhaps make another npm command to run both at once)

run command: npm run build_and_run

or do the steps separately

run: npm run build
   (this builds the react app into the build folder)

then run: npm start 
   (to start the server)
